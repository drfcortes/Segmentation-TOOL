# Segmentation-TOOL
In this research endeavor, we investigate the extensive potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms within the realm of medical imaging, with a specific focus on their application in Mid-Middle Lateral Oblique Screen-Film Mammography (MMLOSFM). We acknowledge the profound implications of AI for diverse medical imaging tasks, including image generation, diagnosis, classification, and predictive pathology assessment.
A fundamental challenge in the development and clinical deployment of AI algorithms is the scarcity of comprehensive and representative training datasets, complete with expert manual labeling. Existing supervised AI methodologies necessitate a data preprocessing stage for optimal alignment with the ground truth. 
In this context, our study introduces a graphical user interface designed for the semi-automatic annotation of Regions of Interest (ROIs) in MMLOSFM images. This annotation process is facilitated through preprocessing techniques, notably segmentation and image enhancement. Segmentation involves the precise delineation of pertinent image regions (i.e., ROIs), and subsequent labeling. Image enhancement techniques are employed to rectify issues such as contrast, brightness, and noise, ultimately improving the identification of pertinent structures.
The effectiveness of our approach was rigorously evaluated utilizing four structural comparison indices, demonstrating the efficient segmentation and labeling of MMLOSFM images. Notably, we achieved a remarkable level of congruence, with a consistent similarity score of 91.6% when compared to the ground truth, as provided by the MIAS database.
In summary, our research is dedicated to the development of a sophisticated toolset for the expedited and precise labeling of Regions of Interest in MMLOSFM mammographic images, employing advanced image processing techniques. This innovation holds substantial promise for the advancement of AI algorithms in the domain of breast disease detection and diagnostic assessment from medical images. Importantly, we proudly present this work as part of the proceedings at the 2023 Global Medical Engineering Physics Exchanges/Pacific Health Care Engineering (GMEPE/PAHCE) conference.
